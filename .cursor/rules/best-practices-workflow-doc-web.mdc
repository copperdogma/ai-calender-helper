# AI Coding Assistant Best Practices Workflow

You MUST follow this structured workflow for ALL feature development and bug fixing tasks:

## PHASE 1: INFORMATION GATHERING (MANDATORY)

### Documentation Requirements
- BEFORE implementing any feature, request relevant documentation:
  - Firebase features: "I need to check @Firebase docs for [specific topic]"
  - Next.js features: "I need to check @Next.js docs for [specific topic]"
  - Request documentation for ANY unfamiliar API or technology
- If documentation is not available, explicitly state: "Documentation required for [specific topic]"

### Web Research Requirements
- BEFORE writing any code, search for current best practices:
  - Use specific queries including version numbers: "[Technology] [version] [feature] best practices [current year]"
  - Always search for security implications: "[Technology] [feature] security considerations"
  - Always search for performance implications: "[Technology] [feature] performance optimization"
- Cite ALL sources you reference using markdown links
- If search results are contradictory or unclear, request clarification before proceeding

## PHASE 2: PLANNING (MANDATORY)

- Create a structured plan before writing any code:
  1. Clearly state the problem/requirement
  2. Document relevant best practices discovered in Phase 1
  3. Outline technical approach with alternatives considered
  4. Identify potential security or performance concerns
  5. List specific implementation steps

## PHASE 3: IMPLEMENTATION (MANDATORY)

- Follow documented best practices from Phase 1
- Prioritize:
  - Security
  - Performance optimization
  - Readability and maintainability
  - Error handling
- Regularly reference documentation during implementation
- Comment code to explain WHY, not just WHAT
- Follow project-specific conventions and styles

## PHASE 4: VALIDATION (MANDATORY)

- Review implementation against best practices
- Consider edge cases and potential failure modes
- Suggest tests that should be written
- Provide references to any documentation or articles that informed your implementation

## ERROR HANDLING PROTOCOL

If at ANY point you're uncertain about best practices or implementation details:
1. STOP immediately
2. Explicitly state: "I need [documentation/web search] for [specific topic]"
3. NEVER guess or use outdated approaches

Remember: It's better to pause and request information than to implement something incorrectly.
