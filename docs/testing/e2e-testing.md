# End-to-End Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines our end-to-end (E2E) testing strategy for the AI Calendar Helper application. E2E tests verify that the entire application works as expected from a user's perspective by interacting with the application through the browser.

## Technology Stack

- **Testing Framework**: Playwright
- **Browser Coverage**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari (WebKit)
- **Mobile Testing**: Responsive testing on mobile viewports
- **Accessibility Testing**: Integrated via axe-core
- **Visual Testing**: Screenshot comparison on failure

## Test Organization

Our E2E tests are organized into the following categories:

1. **Authentication Tests**: Verify login/logout flows and protected routes
2. **Calendar Event Tests**: Test CRUD operations for calendar events
3. **Navigation Tests**: Ensure proper application structure and navigation
4. **Accessibility Tests**: Verify compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards

## Authentication Testing Strategy

Since our application uses Firebase Authentication with Google Sign-in, we've adopted the following approaches for testing auth flows:

1. **Mocked Authentication**: For most tests, we mock the Firebase auth state to avoid actual OAuth flows
2. **LocalStorage Simulation**: We simulate authenticated state by setting appropriate localStorage entries
3. **Custom Events**: We dispatch custom events to notify the application of auth state changes
4. **Protected Routes**: We verify that unauthenticated users are redirected to the login page

## Test Database Strategy

For tests that interact with the database:

1. **Isolated Test Database**: We use a separate database for E2E tests to avoid affecting production data
2. **Data Seeding**: Each test begins with a known state through predictable data seeding
3. **Clean Slate**: After each test run, we clean up test data to ensure test isolation

## Running E2E Tests

The following npm scripts are available for running E2E tests:

```bash
# Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run with UI mode for debugging
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Run with debugging enabled
npm run test:e2e:debug

# View latest test report
npm run test:e2e:report
```

## CI/CD Integration

E2E tests are integrated into our CI/CD pipeline in the following ways:

1. **Pull Request Checks**: E2E tests run on PRs targeting main branches
2. **Deployment Verification**: Tests run after deployment to verify functionality
3. **Scheduled Runs**: Regular E2E test runs against production environment

*Note: The CI/CD integration will be fully implemented in Phase 4 (Story-025).*

## Test Data Management

Test data is managed using the following approaches:

1. **Fixture Files**: Reusable test data defined in fixtures
2. **API Seeding**: Some tests use API calls to pre-seed data
3. **UI Actions**: Some tests create data through UI interactions
4. **Data Cleanup**: All tests clean up after themselves

4. **Browser Compatibility**:
   - **Challenge**: Tests using browser-specific CDP APIs may fail in certain browsers
   - **Solution**: Implement feature detection and graceful degradation for browser-specific features

## Best Practices

When writing or maintaining E2E tests:

1. **Test Isolation**: Each test should be independent and not rely on state from other tests
2. **Stable Selectors**: Use data-testid attributes instead of relying on text content or CSS classes
3. **Realistic Flows**: Tests should simulate real user journeys through the application
4. **Inclusive Testing**: Test across browsers, devices, and accessibility requirements
5. **Fast Feedback**: Optimize test speed while maintaining reliability
6. **Maintainability**: Keep tests clear, well-documented, and easy to update

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Authentication Testing**: 
   - **Challenge**: Testing Google OAuth flows
   - **Solution**: Mock authentication state using localStorage and custom events

2. **Test Reliability**:
   - **Challenge**: Flaky tests due to timing or network issues
   - **Solution**: Implement proper waiting strategies and retry mechanisms

3. **Test Data Management**:
   - **Challenge**: Ensuring test isolation while maintaining realistic data
   - **Solution**: Dedicated test database and proper cleanup between tests

## Cross-Browser Compatibility

To ensure tests run reliably across different browsers:

1. **Feature Detection**: Always check if browser features exist before using them
   ```typescript
   const memoryInfo = await client.send('Memory.getBrowserMemoryUsage')
     .catch(error => {
       console.log('Memory API not available, skipping test');
       return null;
     });
   
   if (memoryInfo) {
     // Perform tests that require this API
   }
   ```

2. **Graceful Degradation**: Include fallbacks when features are unavailable
3. **Soft Assertions**: Use try/catch with logging rather than hard failures for non-critical checks
4. **Test Annotations**: Mark tests with annotations explaining why they might be skipped
5. **Alternative Authentication Methods**: Use both cookies and localStorage approaches with fallbacks

## Future Enhancements

While our current E2E testing foundation is solid, the following enhancements are recommended for future implementation:

1. **Visual Testing**:
   - Implement screenshot comparison for critical UI components
   - Compare visual snapshots against baselines to detect visual regressions
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     test('visual appearance check', async ({ page }) => {
       await page.goto('/');
       expect(await page.screenshot()).toMatchSnapshot('homepage.png');
     });
     ```

2. **Network Request Mocking**:
   - Mock API responses for consistent test behavior
   - Test error states and edge cases more reliably
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     test('test with mocked API', async ({ page }) => {
       await page.route('/api/data', route => route.fulfill({
         status: 200,
         body: JSON.stringify({ key: 'test-data' })
       }));
       await page.goto('/dashboard');
     });
     ```

3. **Mobile Device Emulation**:
   - Add specific device profiles for mobile testing
   - Test touch interactions and mobile-specific behavior
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     test.use({ viewport: devices['iPhone 13'].viewport });
     test('mobile layout', async ({ page }) => {
       // Test mobile-specific behavior
     });
     ```

4. **Test Tracing for Debugging**:
   - Implement trace collection for complex test scenarios
   - Help with troubleshooting failures in CI environments
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     test('important user flow', async ({ page }) => {
       await page.context().tracing.start({ screenshots: true, snapshots: true });
       // Test steps
       await page.context().tracing.stop({ path: 'trace.zip' });
     });
     ```

5. **Component-Level Testing**:
   - Implement Playwright component testing for faster feedback
   - Test components in isolation before integration
   - Requires setup with the appropriate framework adapter (React, Vue, etc.)

These enhancements would elevate our testing approach and provide more comprehensive coverage, but they are not critical for the initial implementation phase.
