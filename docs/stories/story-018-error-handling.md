# Story: Error Handling & Recovery

**Status**: To Do

---

## Related Requirement
[Technical Requirements](../requirements.md#technical-requirements)
- "Error handling for invalid or ambiguous inputs"
- "Strong data validation and error handling"

## Alignment with Design
[Error Handling](../design.md#error-handling)
- "User-facing Errors":
  ```typescript
  class ErrorHandler {
    /**
     * Handle and normalize AI processing errors
     */
    handleAIProcessingError(error: any): UserFacingError;
    
    /**
     * Handle calendar API errors
     */
    handleCalendarError(error: any): UserFacingError;
  }
  ```

[System Errors](../design.md#error-handling)
- "Graceful degradation"
- "Automatic retry mechanisms"
- "Error tracking and monitoring"
- "Admin notifications for critical issues"

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] System provides user-friendly error messages for all failures
- [ ] Error messages include helpful suggestions for resolution
- [ ] API failures are gracefully handled with appropriate messaging
- [ ] Field validation provides clear guidance on input requirements
- [ ] System implements appropriate retry mechanisms for transient errors
- [ ] Error logging captures sufficient details for troubleshooting
- [ ] Critical errors trigger appropriate notifications
- [ ] System degrades gracefully when services are unavailable
- [ ] Error tracking includes categorization and severity levels
- [ ] Recovery paths are provided where possible
- [ ] User must sign off on functionality before story can be marked complete

## Tasks
- [ ] Design error handling strategy and architecture
- [ ] Implement centralized error handling service
- [ ] Create user-facing error components
- [ ] Develop field validation system
- [ ] Implement retry mechanisms for API calls
- [ ] Set up error logging and monitoring
- [ ] Create notification system for critical errors
- [ ] Implement graceful degradation for service outages
- [ ] Add categorization and severity to error tracking
- [ ] Build recovery paths for common error scenarios
- [ ] Test various error conditions and recovery
- [ ] Document error handling approach

## Notes
- Focus on user-friendly error messages that avoid technical jargon
- Provide actionable guidance in error messages
- Consider different error handling strategies for different parts of the application
- Implement progressive enhancement for graceful degradation
- Error recovery should aim to preserve user data and progress
- Consider implementing feature flags for problematic features
- This is a cross-cutting concern affecting all parts of the application
- Error handling should be consistent throughout the application
- Consider internationalization aspects of error messages
