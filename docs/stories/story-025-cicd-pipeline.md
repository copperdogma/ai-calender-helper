# Story 025: CI/CD Pipeline Setup

## Overview
Implement a continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline to automate testing, building, and deployment processes.

## Priority
Medium

## Status
To Do

## Phase
Phase 4 (Additional Enhancements)

## Requirements

### Continuous Integration
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions workflow
- [ ] Configure automated testing on pull requests
  - [ ] Run unit tests
  - [ ] Run integration tests
  - [ ] Run E2E tests
- [ ] Set up E2E testing infrastructure
  - [ ] Install and configure Playwright for E2E testing
  - [ ] Configure E2E test environment
  - [ ] Set up test data fixtures
  - [ ] Create initial E2E test suite
  - [ ] Add critical path tests
  - [ ] Add error scenario tests
  - [ ] Update package.json with E2E test scripts
    - [ ] Add `test:e2e` script for local testing
    - [ ] Add `test:e2e:ci` script for CI environment
  - [ ] Configure proper environment variables for E2E tests in CI
  - [ ] Set up GitHub Actions workflow specific for Playwright tests
    - [ ] Configure browser cache and dependencies
    - [ ] Set up parallel test execution
    - [ ] Configure artifact collection for test reports and screenshots
- [ ] Add code quality checks
  - [ ] ESLint
  - [ ] TypeScript type checking
  - [ ] Test coverage reports
- [ ] Implement build verification
  - [ ] Verify production build succeeds
  - [ ] Check for build size and performance metrics

### Continuous Deployment
- [ ] Set up staging environment
- [ ] Configure automated deployments
  - [ ] Deploy to staging on merge to development branch
  - [ ] Deploy to production on merge to main branch
- [ ] Implement deployment verification
  - [ ] Health checks
  - [ ] Smoke tests
  - [ ] Run E2E tests against deployed environments
- [ ] Add rollback capabilities

### Documentation
- [ ] Document CI/CD workflow
- [ ] Add deployment instructions
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Document E2E testing setup and maintenance

## Dependencies
- Story 002: User Authentication with Firebase (completed)
- Story 001: Google Calendar API Integration
- Story 023: Test Data Generation

## Acceptance Criteria
1. CI pipeline automatically runs on all pull requests
2. All tests (unit, integration, E2E) run successfully in CI environment
3. Code quality checks are enforced
4. E2E tests cover critical user paths
5. E2E tests run successfully against staging/production environments
6. Automated deployments work for both staging and production
7. Documentation is complete and accurate
8. Rollback process is tested and documented

## Technical Notes
- Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline
- Consider using Vercel or similar for automated deployments
- Ensure environment variables are properly handled
- Set up proper test data management for CI environment
- Utilize Playwright's features for:
  - Cross-browser testing with Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit
  - Powerful authentication handling
  - Integration with existing CI/CD tools
  - Visual comparison and accessibility testing

## Security Considerations
- Protect sensitive environment variables
- Implement proper access controls for deployments
- Secure CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Handle secrets management
- Secure test data and credentials in E2E tests

## Future Considerations
- Performance monitoring integration
- Automated dependency updates
- Advanced deployment strategies (blue-green, canary)
- Integration with monitoring tools
- Visual regression testing
- Parallel test execution for faster CI runs
