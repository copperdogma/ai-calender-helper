**Status**: To Do

## Related Requirement
[Daily Calendar Summary](../requirements.md#1-daily-calendar-summary)
- "System must connect to user's Google Calendar"
- "Ensure read-only access to calendar data for security"

## Alignment with Design
[Architecture Overview - External Services](../architecture.md#external-services)
- "Google Calendar API: Core integration for calendar operations"

[Security Architecture](../architecture.md#security-architecture)
- "OAuth 2.0 authentication with Google"
- "Read-only scopes for calendar access when possible"

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Application can authenticate with Google Calendar API using OAuth 2.0
- [ ] Application can successfully retrieve calendar events with proper permissions
- [ ] Read-only access is enforced for retrieving calendar data
- [ ] Proper error handling is implemented for API failures
- [ ] Token refresh and expiration are handled correctly
- [ ] API requests adhere to rate limits to prevent quota issues
- [ ] User must sign off on functionality before story can be marked complete

## Tasks
- [ ] Set up Google Cloud project and configure OAuth consent screen
- [ ] Create API credentials (OAuth client ID)
- [ ] Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication flow
- [ ] Create CalendarService class with methods for event retrieval
- [ ] Implement API client with proper scopes (read-only)
- [ ] Add token management (storage, refresh, expiration)
- [ ] Implement error handling for API failures
- [ ] Create rate limiting mechanism to prevent quota exhaustion
- [ ] Write tests for calendar integration
- [ ] Document the integration process

## Notes
- Focus on read-only access for this story to ensure security
- Ensure proper token storage and refresh mechanisms
- The integration should support both single-event and recurring event retrieval
- This is a prerequisite for the Novel Events Extraction & Summary feature
