# Story 001: Google Calendar API Integration

## Overview
Implement core integration with Google Calendar API, including authentication, event management, and proper security measures.

## Priority
High

## Status
To Do

## Phase
Phase 1 (Text-to-Calendar MVP)

## Requirements

### API Setup and Configuration
- [ ] Set up Google Cloud project
- [ ] Configure OAuth consent screen
- [ ] Create API credentials (OAuth client ID)
- [ ] Set up environment variables for API keys and secrets

### Core Integration
- [ ] Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication flow
- [ ] Create base API handlers
- [ ] Implement CRUD operations for calendar events
- [ ] Create CalendarService class with event management methods
- [ ] Add token management (storage, refresh, expiration)

### Security and Error Handling
- [ ] Configure API authentication middleware
- [ ] Implement proper error handling for API failures
- [ ] Set up request validation
- [ ] Add rate limiting mechanism
- [ ] Ensure read-only access where appropriate
- [ ] Implement proper scopes for calendar access

### Documentation
- [ ] Create API documentation
- [ ] Document integration process
- [ ] Add usage examples
- [ ] Document error codes and handling
- [ ] Add rate limiting documentation

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Application can authenticate with Google Calendar API using OAuth 2.0
2. Application can successfully perform CRUD operations on calendar events
3. Read-only access is enforced where appropriate
4. Proper error handling is implemented for API failures
5. Token refresh and expiration are handled correctly
6. API requests adhere to rate limits
7. Request validation prevents invalid operations
8. Documentation is complete and accurate
9. Integration tests pass successfully
10. User must sign off on functionality

## Dependencies
- Story 002: User Authentication with Firebase (for user context)

## Technical Notes
- Use Google Calendar API v3
- Implement proper token storage and refresh mechanisms
- Support both single-event and recurring event operations
- Consider implementing retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow REST best practices for API design

## Security Considerations
- Secure storage of API credentials
- Proper scope management
- Rate limiting implementation
- Input validation
- Error message sanitization
- Token security

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for CalendarService
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Authentication flow tests
- Error handling tests
- Rate limiting tests

## Future Considerations
- Batch operations support
- Webhook integration for real-time updates
- Caching layer for frequently accessed data
- Advanced conflict resolution
- Multiple calendar support

## Notes
- This is a core feature required for MVP
- Focus on stability and security
- Required for both text-to-calendar and novel events features

- "System must connect to user's Google Calendar"
- "Ensure read-only access to calendar data for security"

## Alignment with Design
[Architecture Overview - External Services](../architecture.md#external-services)
- "Google Calendar API: Core integration for calendar operations"

[Security Architecture](../architecture.md#security-architecture)
- "OAuth 2.0 authentication with Google"
- "Read-only scopes for calendar access when possible"

## Tasks
- [ ] Set up Google Cloud project and configure OAuth consent screen
- [ ] Create API credentials (OAuth client ID)
- [ ] Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication flow
- [ ] Create CalendarService class with methods for event retrieval
- [ ] Implement API client with proper scopes (read-only)
- [ ] Add token management (storage, refresh, expiration)
- [ ] Implement error handling for API failures
- [ ] Create rate limiting mechanism to prevent quota exhaustion
- [ ] Write tests for calendar integration
- [ ] Document the integration process

## Notes
- Focus on read-only access for this story to ensure security
- Ensure proper token storage and refresh mechanisms
- The integration should support both single-event and recurring event retrieval
- This is a prerequisite for the Novel Events Extraction & Summary feature
