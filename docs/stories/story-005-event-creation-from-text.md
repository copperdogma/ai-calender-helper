# Story: Event Creation from Text

**Status**: To Do

---

## Related Requirement
[Natural Language Event Creation](../requirements.md#2-natural-language-event-creation)
- "Accept unstructured text input describing an event"
- "Parse the text to extract event details"
- "Create a draft Google Calendar event with extracted information"
- "Allow user review before final event creation"

## Alignment with Design
[Feature Implementations - Natural Language Event Creation](../design.md#feature-natural-language-event-creation)
- "Text Processing Pipeline"
- "Event Data Extraction"
- "AI Processing Enhancement"
- "Enhanced Event Creation"

[Data Architecture](../architecture.md#data-architecture)
- "Extracted Event Data Model"

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] System accepts natural language text input describing an event
- [ ] AI successfully extracts structured event data (title, date, time, location, etc.)
- [ ] Event is created in draft form for user review
- [ ] User can edit any extracted information before final creation
- [ ] Event is correctly created in Google Calendar upon confirmation
- [ ] System handles ambiguous or incomplete information appropriately
- [ ] Timezone information is correctly processed and applied
- [ ] Title extraction prioritizes the first line appropriately
- [ ] User must sign off on functionality before story can be marked complete

## Tasks
- [ ] Create user interface for text input
- [ ] Implement text preprocessing for optimal AI processing
- [ ] Connect to GPT4ProcessingService (from Story 004)
- [ ] Add validation and enrichment for extracted data
- [ ] Create draft event view with edit capabilities
- [ ] Implement Google Calendar event creation API
- [ ] Develop confidence scoring visualization
- [ ] Build error handling for extraction failures
- [ ] Create feedback mechanism for extraction improvements
- [ ] Implement timezone detection and handling
- [ ] Add support for title extraction prioritization
- [ ] Create tests with various input scenarios
- [ ] Document the event creation workflow

## Notes
- This feature depends on Natural Language Processing Setup (Story 004)
- The user interface should clearly show confidence in extraction
- Error handling should provide useful guidance when extraction fails
- Extraction should prioritize the first line as the title (per requirements)
- Timezone handling is critical for correct event creation
- Consider implementing fallbacks for low-confidence extractions
- Special consideration needed for handling conference calls and virtual meetings
- Draft view should make it easy to correct any misinterpretations
