- "Support recurring event creation"

[Technical Requirements](../requirements.md#technical-requirements)
- "Support for both single-event and recurring event expansions"

## Alignment with Design
[Feature: Natural Language Event Creation](../design.md#feature-natural-language-event-creation)
- "Recurring event pattern detection"

[Data Architecture](../architecture.md#data-architecture)
- "Event Data Model":
  ```typescript
  interface CalendarEvent {
    // ...
    recurrence?: string[];
  }
  ```
- "Extracted Event Data Model":
  ```typescript
  interface ExtractedEventData {
    // ...
    recurrence?: RecurrenceRule;
  }
  ```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] System detects recurring event patterns from natural language
- [ ] Common recurrence patterns are supported (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly)
- [ ] Complex recurrence rules can be created (e.g., every 2 weeks on Monday and Wednesday)
- [ ] Recurring event preview shows pattern and upcoming instances
- [ ] Recurrence end dates or occurrence counts can be specified
- [ ] Exceptions to recurring events can be added
- [ ] Recurring events are correctly created in Google Calendar
- [ ] Recurring patterns are visually displayed in a user-friendly way
- [ ] Recurrence rules can be edited before event creation
- [ ] User must sign off on functionality before story can be marked complete

## Tasks
- [ ] Enhance GPT4ProcessingService to extract recurrence patterns
- [ ] Create RecurrenceRule data model
- [ ] Implement recurrence pattern detection from text
- [ ] Build recurring event preview component
- [ ] Develop recurrence rule editor interface
- [ ] Create visual recurrence pattern display
- [ ] Implement exception handling for recurring events
- [ ] Add recurrence end date/count configuration
- [ ] Create Google Calendar RRULE formatting
- [ ] Implement recurring event creation API integration
- [ ] Add validation for recurrence rules
- [ ] Test with various recurrence patterns
- [ ] Document recurring event functionality

## Notes
- Use iCalendar RRULE format for compatibility with Google Calendar
- Consider natural language examples that would trigger each recurrence pattern
- Pay special attention to edge cases like month-end rules, leap years
- Provide clear visual indicators of recurrence pattern in the UI
- Ensure the GPT-4 prompt includes specific examples of recurring event phrases
- Implement appropriate default recurrence end dates based on pattern
- This feature allows for significant time savings for users with regular events
- Coordinate with Timezone Handling (Story 007) for correct recurring time handling
- Consider offering templates for common recurring patterns (weekly meetings, monthly reviews, etc.)
