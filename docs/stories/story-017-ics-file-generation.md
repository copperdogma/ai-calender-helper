**Status**: To Do

## Related Requirement
[Technical Requirements](../requirements.md#technical-requirements)
- "ICS file generation for calendar event sharing"

[Extended Features (Post-MVP)](../requirements.md#extended-features-post-mvp)
- "ICS file import/export for calendar portability"

## Alignment with Design
[Feature: Daily Novel Events Summary](../design.md#feature-daily-novel-events-summary)
- "Generate an ICS file for download/sharing":
  ```typescript
  generateICSFile(event: ExtractedEventData | CalendarEvent): string {
    // Generate an ICS file for download/sharing
    const icsData = [
      'BEGIN:VCALENDAR',
      'VERSION:2.0',
      'PRODID:-//AI Calendar Helper//EN',
      'BEGIN:VEVENT',
      `SUMMARY:${event.title}`,
      `DTSTART:${this.formatICSDate(event.startTime)}`,
      `DTEND:${this.formatICSDate(event.endTime || this.calculateEndTime(event))}`,
      event.location ? `LOCATION:${event.location}` : '',
      event.description ? `DESCRIPTION:${event.description}` : '',
      // Add other fields as needed
      'END:VEVENT',
      'END:VCALENDAR'
    ].filter(Boolean).join('\r\n');
    
    return icsData;
  }
  ```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] System generates valid ICS files for events
- [ ] ICS files include all essential event details
- [ ] Single events can be exported to ICS
- [ ] Multiple events can be exported in a single ICS file
- [ ] Recurring events are properly formatted in ICS
- [ ] Download option is available from event preview
- [ ] ICS files are compatible with major calendar applications
- [ ] Timezone information is preserved in ICS files
- [ ] ICS generation handles special characters correctly
- [ ] ICS file naming follows user-friendly conventions
- [ ] User must sign off on functionality before story can be marked complete

## Tasks
- [ ] Implement ICS file generation service
- [ ] Create ICS format conversion for event data
- [ ] Add proper timezone handling in ICS
- [ ] Build ICS file download functionality
- [ ] Create UI elements for ICS export
- [ ] Implement batch ICS generation for multiple events
- [ ] Add support for recurring events in ICS
- [ ] Create proper escaping for special characters
- [ ] Implement intelligent file naming
- [ ] Test compatibility with various calendar applications
- [ ] Add validation for generated ICS files
- [ ] Document ICS generation functionality

## Notes
- Follow iCalendar (RFC 5545) specification for compatibility
- Ensure proper escaping of special characters in all fields
- Pay special attention to timezone handling, especially for recurring events
- Consider using an established library like ical.js for reliable ICS generation
- Provide clear UI indicators for ICS download options
- File naming should include event title and date for easy identification
- This feature increases portability by allowing users to share events across platforms
- Post-MVP, consider adding ICS import capabilities for greater flexibility
- Ensure proper error handling for ICS generation failures
