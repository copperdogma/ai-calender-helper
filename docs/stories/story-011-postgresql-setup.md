## Related Requirement
[Technical Requirements](../requirements.md#technical-requirements)
- "Support for both single-event and recurring event expansions"
- "Strong data validation and error handling"
- "Comprehensive event data model with all required fields"

## Alignment with Design
[External Services](../architecture.md#external-services)
- "PostgreSQL: User preferences and configuration storage"

[Infrastructure Architecture](../architecture.md#infrastructure-architecture)
- "Database: PostgreSQL for persistent storage"

[Data Architecture](../architecture.md#data-architecture)
- "User Preferences Model"
- "Event Data Model"
- "Extracted Event Data Model"

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] PostgreSQL database is properly set up and configured
- [ ] Schema includes all required tables and relationships
- [ ] Database migration system is implemented
- [ ] Models are created for user preferences storage
- [ ] Proper indexing is implemented for optimal performance
- [ ] Security best practices are followed for data protection
- [ ] Backup and recovery mechanisms are in place
- [ ] Connection pooling is properly configured
- [ ] Error handling is robust for database operations
- [ ] User must sign off on functionality before story can be marked complete

## Tasks
- [ ] Set up PostgreSQL database instance
- [ ] Design database schema based on data models
- [ ] Create migration system for schema versioning
- [ ] Implement data models and repositories
- [ ] Set up proper indexes for performance optimization
- [ ] Configure connection pooling
- [ ] Implement secure credentials management
- [ ] Create backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Set up database monitoring
- [ ] Test database performance under load
- [ ] Document database schema and access patterns
- [ ] Implement error handling for database operations

## Notes
- Focus on security and data integrity
- Schema should be flexible enough to accommodate future feature additions
- Implement proper constraints and foreign keys
- Consider data retention policies
- This database will primarily store user preferences, not calendar events
- Calendar events will be fetched directly from Google Calendar
- This component is part of the core infrastructure
