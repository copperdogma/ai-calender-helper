- Testing natural language processing with varied inputs

[Novel Events Extraction](../requirements.md#2-novel-events-extraction-secondary-feature)
- Testing novel events detection and filtering

## Alignment with Design
[Text-to-Calendar Feature](../design.md#feature-text-to-calendar-primary-feature)
- Testing text processing pipeline

[Novel Events Extraction Feature](../design.md#feature-novel-events-extraction-background-service)
- Testing novel events filtering logic

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Generate large set of plain text calendar events for text-to-calendar testing
- [ ] Text samples cover various event types, formats, and complexities
- [ ] Generate JSON calendar files with large numbers of events for novel events extraction testing
- [ ] Calendar data includes mix of recurring and non-recurring events
- [ ] Test data covers edge cases and common scenarios
- [ ] Data generation is reproducible and configurable
- [ ] Test data accurately represents real-world usage patterns
- [ ] Test data is properly documented for use in testing
- [ ] User must sign off on functionality before story can be marked complete

## Tasks
### Text-to-Calendar Test Data
- [ ] Create script to generate varied plain text calendar events
- [ ] Include variations in date/time formats
- [ ] Include different types of events (meetings, appointments, etc.)
- [ ] Add varying levels of detail and complexity
- [ ] Include edge cases (missing information, ambiguous times)
- [ ] Generate multi-line and single-line event descriptions
- [ ] Include recurring event descriptions
- [ ] Create conversion validation tool

### Novel Events Extraction Test Data
- [ ] Create script to generate JSON calendar files
- [ ] Include mix of recurring and non-recurring events
- [ ] Generate events across various time spans
- [ ] Add proper categorization to test filtering
- [ ] Include events with different priorities
- [ ] Create data with timezone variations
- [ ] Generate various volumes of data for performance testing
- [ ] Build validation tool for generated data

## Notes
- Test data should balance realism with coverage of edge cases
- Consider using templates with randomized elements for variety
- Data generation scripts should be part of the development/test tools
- Include documentation on how to use the test data
- Store test data in a dedicated test resources directory
- Consider including real-world examples alongside generated data
- Ensure test data doesn't contain any personally identifiable information
- Test data should be versioned alongside the codebase
