# Story: Natural Language Processing Setup

**Status**: To Do

---

## Related Requirement
[Natural Language Event Creation](../requirements.md#2-natural-language-event-creation)
- "Accept unstructured text input describing an event"
- "Parse the text to extract event information"
- "Reliable text parsing for event creation using AI"

## Alignment with Design
[Technology Stack - External Services](../architecture.md#external-services)
- "OpenAI GPT-4 API: Natural language processing for event extraction"

[Feature Implementations - Natural Language Event Creation](../design.md#feature-natural-language-event-creation)
- "GPT-4 API call for structured data extraction with prompt engineering"
- "AI Processing Enhancement"

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Application can connect to GPT-4 API securely
- [ ] System prompt is designed and optimized for event extraction
- [ ] API integration handles rate limiting and retries
- [ ] Event extraction returns structured data in expected format
- [ ] API keys are stored securely
- [ ] Error handling for API failures is implemented
- [ ] Test cases demonstrate accurate extraction for various text inputs
- [ ] Configuration allows for model selection and parameter adjustment
- [ ] User must sign off on functionality before story can be marked complete

## Tasks
- [ ] Set up OpenAI API credentials
- [ ] Implement secure API key storage
- [ ] Create GPT4ProcessingService with extractEventDetails method
- [ ] Design system prompt with examples for optimal extraction
- [ ] Implement JSON response parsing and validation
- [ ] Create rate limiting and retry mechanisms
- [ ] Build error handling for API failures
- [ ] Develop test suite with various text input scenarios
- [ ] Document the NLP integration and prompt design
- [ ] Analyze and optimize prompt for extraction accuracy

## Notes
- The system prompt is critical for extraction accuracy
- Focus on a single comprehensive prompt rather than multiple specialized prompts
- Use low temperature setting (0.1) for consistent structured output
- Ensure the service can extract all required event fields:
  - title, startTime, endTime, location, description, attendees, recurrence
- This is a prerequisite for the Event Creation from Text feature
