# Story: Timezone Handling

**Status**: To Do

---

## Related Requirement
[Technical Requirements](../requirements.md#technical-requirements)
- "Proper timezone handling for all calendar operations"
- "Timezone detection based on event location"

[Daily Calendar Summary](../requirements.md#1-daily-calendar-summary)
- "Preserve timezone information for accurate event timing"

## Alignment with Design
[Feature: Daily Novel Events Summary](../design.md#feature-daily-novel-events-summary)
- "Implement timezone detection and conversion"

[TimezoneService](../design.md)
```typescript
class TimezoneService {
  /**
   * Detect timezone from location string
   */
  async detectFromLocation(location: string): Promise<string>;
  
  /**
   * Validate if a timezone string is a valid IANA timezone
   */
  validateTimezone(timezone: string): boolean;
  
  /**
   * Get user's default timezone
   */
  getUserDefaultTimezone(): string;
  
  /**
   * Convert a date to a specific timezone
   */
  convertToTimezone(date: Date, timezone: string): Date;
}
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] System correctly detects and handles user timezone
- [ ] Events are displayed in the user's local timezone
- [ ] Timezone is detected from event location when possible
- [ ] System handles timezone conversions correctly
- [ ] Daylight saving time transitions are properly managed
- [ ] Timezone information is preserved when creating events
- [ ] User can override default timezone settings
- [ ] Invalid timezones are handled gracefully
- [ ] Cross-timezone scheduling is accurate
- [ ] User must sign off on functionality before story can be marked complete

## Tasks
- [ ] Implement TimezoneService with all required methods
- [ ] Create user timezone detection on application startup
- [ ] Implement location-based timezone detection
- [ ] Add timezone conversion utilities
- [ ] Create validation for timezone strings
- [ ] Build timezone selection component for user preferences
- [ ] Implement timezone display in event views
- [ ] Handle daylight saving time edge cases
- [ ] Add timezone indicators to the UI
- [ ] Ensure proper timezone handling in calendar API operations
- [ ] Test with various timezone scenarios
- [ ] Document timezone handling approach

## Notes
- Use IANA timezone database for consistency
- Handle edge cases like DST transitions carefully
- Provide clear timezone indicators in the UI
- Consider caching timezone data to reduce API calls
- Implement fallback strategies when location-based detection fails
- This functionality is crucial for accurate event timing
- Special handling needed for all-day events vs. time-specific events
- Consider timezone differences when calculating event durations
