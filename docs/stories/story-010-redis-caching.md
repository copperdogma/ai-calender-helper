# Story: Redis Caching Implementation

**Status**: To Do

---

## Related Requirement
[Technical Requirements](../requirements.md#technical-requirements)
- "Fast processing time (near-instant event creation)"
- "Minimial local storage (no persistent event data)"

## Alignment with Design
[Technology Stack](../design.md#technology-stack)
- "Redis for rate limiting and caching frequent requests"

[Feature Implementations - Daily Novel Events Summary](../design.md#feature-daily-novel-events-summary)
- "Enhanced caching strategy:
  - Store daily summaries in Redis with 1-hour TTL
  - Update cache when new events are created
  - Maintain no persistent event storage (following reference implementation)
  - Cache only processed summaries, not raw event data"

[External Services](../architecture.md#external-services)
- "Redis: Caching and rate limiting"

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Redis is properly set up and configured
- [ ] Caching strategy is implemented for daily summaries
- [ ] Rate limiting is configured for external API calls (Google Calendar, OpenAI)
- [ ] Cache invalidation works correctly when new events are created
- [ ] TTL (time-to-live) is properly configured for cached data
- [ ] Performance improvements are measurable with caching
- [ ] Error handling accounts for Redis connection issues
- [ ] Fallback mechanisms exist when cache is unavailable
- [ ] User must sign off on functionality before story can be marked complete

## Tasks
- [ ] Set up Redis instance
- [ ] Configure Redis connection in the application
- [ ] Implement caching layer for calendar events
- [ ] Create rate limiting middleware for API calls
- [ ] Implement cache invalidation strategy
- [ ] Set up TTL for different types of cached data
- [ ] Add cache hit/miss monitoring
- [ ] Create fallback mechanisms for Redis failures
- [ ] Implement error handling for Redis operations
- [ ] Test cache performance under load
- [ ] Measure and document performance improvements
- [ ] Document caching strategy and implementation

## Notes
- Focus on performance optimization without compromising reliability
- Store only processed data, not raw event data, to minimize storage needs
- Implement separate caching strategies for different types of data
- Cache invalidation is critical for data consistency
- Consider Redis Cluster for production deployment
- This component interacts with both the Daily Summary and Event Creation features
- TTL should be carefully configured to balance freshness and performance
