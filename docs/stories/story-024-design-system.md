# Story 024: Design System & Theme Implementation

## Overview
Implement a comprehensive design system that combines Material UI theming with our custom styles, ensuring consistent visual language across the application.

## Priority
Medium

## Story Points
5

## Description
As the application grows, we need a consistent and maintainable design system that combines Material UI's theming capabilities with our custom styling needs. This should be implemented once we have actual UI components to theme and real use cases to address.

### Requirements
1. Material UI Theme Configuration
   - Define custom color palette based on actual UI needs
   - Set up typography scale
   - Configure component default props
   - Implement component style overrides
   - Define spacing and breakpoint system
   - Set up shape configurations (border radius, etc.)

2. CSS Variables System
   - Extend current light/dark mode variables
   - Define semantic color tokens:
     - Primary/Secondary actions
     - Success/Error/Warning states
     - Surface variations
     - Border colors
     - Shadow levels
   - Create spacing variables
   - Define animation tokens

3. Tailwind Integration
   - Extend Tailwind's theme to match Material UI tokens
   - Create custom utility classes for repeated patterns
   - Set up consistent spacing scale
   - Configure color palette utilities

4. Documentation
   - Create theme usage guidelines
   - Document available variables and utilities
   - Provide component styling examples
   - Add dark mode implementation guide

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Material UI theme provider is configured with custom theme
- [ ] CSS variables are defined and documented
- [ ] Tailwind configuration extends theme tokens
- [ ] Dark mode works consistently across all components
- [ ] Theme documentation is complete and clear
- [ ] All existing components use the theme system
- [ ] Visual regression tests pass

## Dependencies
- Story 013: Web UI - Event Creation Interface
- Basic component library implementation

## Notes
- Implementation should be driven by actual UI needs rather than theoretical use cases
- Theme should be implemented incrementally as components are built
- Focus on maintainability and developer experience
- Consider accessibility in color choices and contrast ratios
