# Story: Confidence Scoring for Extracted Events

**Status**: To Do

## Related Requirement
[Natural Language Event Creation](../requirements.md#2-natural-language-event-creation)
- "Include confidence scoring for extracted fields"
- "Suggest intelligent defaults for missing information"

[Technical Requirements](../requirements.md#technical-requirements)
- "Error handling for invalid or ambiguous inputs"

## Alignment with Design
[Feature Implementations - Natural Language Event Creation](../design.md#feature-natural-language-event-creation)
- "AI Processing Enhancement"
- "Event Data Extraction":
  ```typescript
  interface ExtractedEventData {
    // ...
    confidence: {                 // Field-level confidence scores
      title: number;              // 0-1 score
      startTime: number;
      endTime: number;
      location: number;
      attendees: number;
      recurrence: number;
    };
  }
  ```

[Error Handling - User-facing Errors](../design.md#error-handling)
- "User-facing Errors" for graceful error handling

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Each extracted field includes a confidence score (0-1)
- [ ] Confidence scores are visually displayed in the UI
- [ ] Low-confidence fields are highlighted for user attention
- [ ] System suggests alternatives for low-confidence fields
- [ ] Intelligent defaults are provided for missing fields
- [ ] User is guided to fix low-confidence or missing information
- [ ] System explains reasoning for low-confidence extractions
- [ ] Confidence thresholds are configurable
- [ ] Feedback from user corrections improves future extraction
- [ ] Performance metrics track confidence accuracy over time
- [ ] User must sign off on functionality before story can be marked complete

## Tasks
- [ ] Enhance GPT4ProcessingService to output confidence scores
- [ ] Design visual indicators for confidence levels
- [ ] Implement confidence score calculation logic
- [ ] Create visual highlighting for low-confidence fields
- [ ] Build alternative suggestion system
- [ ] Develop intelligent defaults for missing information
- [ ] Add explanation tooltips for confidence scores
- [ ] Implement confidence threshold configuration
- [ ] Create feedback collection mechanism for corrections
- [ ] Set up analytics for confidence accuracy tracking
- [ ] Integrate with Event Preview & Editing (Story 008)
- [ ] Test with various ambiguous inputs
- [ ] Document confidence scoring system

## Notes
- Use color coding (red/yellow/green) for quick visual assessment
- Balance informativeness with avoiding UI clutter
- Consider confidence trends across different field types
- Low confidence should not block event creation but guide improvement
- This feature is key to building user trust in the AI extraction
- Ensure explanations for low confidence are actionable and clear
- Consider showing comparative scores when suggesting alternatives
- Coordinate closely with the Event Preview & Editing feature (Story 008)
- This system should improve over time based on user corrections
