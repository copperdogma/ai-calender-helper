# Story: Security Implementations

**Status**: To Do

---

## Related Requirement
[Technical Requirements](../requirements.md#technical-requirements)
- "OAuth 2.0 implementation with secure credential storage"
- "Secure Google Calendar API integration"

## Alignment with Design
[Security Architecture](../architecture.md#security-architecture)
- "OAuth 2.0 authentication with Google"
- "Secure credential storage with encryption"
- "CSRF protection for all forms"
- "Rate limiting to prevent abuse"
- "Input sanitization and validation"
- "Read-only scopes for calendar access when possible"
- "HTTPS for all communications"
- "API key rotation policy"
- "Audit logging for sensitive operations"

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All API credentials are securely stored
- [ ] Authentication uses OAuth 2.0 with appropriate scopes
- [ ] CSRF protection is implemented for all forms
- [ ] Input validation is applied to all user inputs
- [ ] Rate limiting is implemented for API endpoints
- [ ] All communications use HTTPS
- [ ] Sensitive operations are logged for audit purposes
- [ ] Security headers are properly configured
- [ ] Secure coding practices are followed throughout
- [ ] Vulnerability scanning is implemented
- [ ] User must sign off on functionality before story can be marked complete

## Tasks
- [ ] Implement secure credential storage
- [ ] Configure OAuth 2.0 with appropriate scopes
- [ ] Add CSRF protection to all forms
- [ ] Create input validation middleware
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- [ ] Configure HTTPS for all communications
- [ ] Set up audit logging for sensitive operations
- [ ] Add security headers configuration
- [ ] Create secure coding guidelines
- [ ] Set up vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Perform security review and testing
- [ ] Document security implementations

## Notes
- OAuth 2.0 should use the principle of least privilege
- Credentials should never be stored in plaintext or client-side
- CSRF tokens should be implemented for all state-changing operations
- Input validation should prevent common injection attacks
- Rate limiting should be applied at both user and IP levels
- Consider security implications of third-party libraries
- Audit logging should not include sensitive personal data
- Security headers should include CSP, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.
- This is a cross-cutting concern that affects all parts of the application
- Regular security reviews should be scheduled
