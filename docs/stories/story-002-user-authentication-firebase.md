# Story: User Authentication with Firebase

**Status**: To Do

---

## Related Requirement
[Technical Requirements](../requirements.md#technical-requirements)
- "User authentication and authorization"
- "OAuth 2.0 implementation with secure credential storage"

## Alignment with Design
[External Services](../architecture.md#external-services)
- "Firebase: Authentication and potentially Google Calendar access"

[Security Architecture](../architecture.md#security-architecture)
- "OAuth 2.0 authentication with Google"
- "Secure credential storage with encryption"

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can sign in with Google account via Firebase
- [ ] Authentication state persists between sessions
- [ ] Protected routes redirect unauthenticated users to sign-in
- [ ] User profiles are stored securely in Firebase
- [ ] Sign-out functionality is implemented
- [ ] Error handling for authentication failures is in place
- [ ] Security best practices are followed
- [ ] User must sign off on functionality before story can be marked complete

## Tasks
- [ ] Set up Firebase project
- [ ] Configure Google authentication provider in Firebase
- [ ] Implement AuthContext for React app with Firebase integration
- [ ] Create sign-in component with Google provider
- [ ] Implement authentication state persistence
- [ ] Create protected route wrapper component
- [ ] Set up Firebase security rules
- [ ] Implement sign-out functionality
- [ ] Add error handling for authentication flows
- [ ] Create user profile management
- [ ] Test authentication flows thoroughly
- [ ] Document the authentication implementation

## Notes
- Integration with Google Calendar API will leverage the same Google authentication flow
- Firebase Authentication provides a secure and well-tested authentication solution
- User profile data should be stored with appropriate access controls
- This authentication system will be a foundation for all user-specific features
- This is a prerequisite for personalized calendar access
