# Story: Batch Event Creation (Possible Future Enhancement)

**Status**: To Do

**Note**: This feature has been marked as a possible future enhancement and is not intended for the initial release of the application. It will be considered for implementation in future versions based on user feedback and needs.

## Related Requirement
[Natural Language Event Creation](../requirements.md#2-natural-language-event-creation)
- "Support batch creation of multiple events from a single text input"

[Success Criteria](../requirements.md#success-criteria)
- "Support for creating multiple events in a single operation"
- "Minimal user intervention needed for basic event creation"

## Alignment with Design
[Enhanced Event Creation](../design.md#feature-natural-language-event-creation)
- "Batch event preview and editing"

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] System identifies multiple events from a single text input
- [ ] Batch preview shows all detected events with clear separation
- [ ] User can edit individual events within the batch
- [ ] Events can be selectively included or excluded from the batch
- [ ] Common fields across multiple events can be edited together
- [ ] Batch creation progress is clearly communicated
- [ ] Success/failure status is shown for each event in the batch
- [ ] Error handling allows partially successful batches
- [ ] Preview provides clear count of total events detected
- [ ] Batch size limits are enforced for performance
- [ ] User must sign off on functionality before story can be marked complete

## Tasks
- [ ] Enhance GPT4ProcessingService to extract multiple events
- [ ] Implement event boundary detection algorithm
- [ ] Create multi-event preview UI
- [ ] Build batch event editor interface
- [ ] Implement selective inclusion/exclusion controls
- [ ] Add batch-wide editing capabilities
- [ ] Create progress indicator for batch operations
- [ ] Implement individual event status tracking
- [ ] Add error recovery for partial batch failures
- [ ] Create batch summary view
- [ ] Set up batch size limits and validation
- [ ] Test with various multi-event scenarios
- [ ] Document batch creation functionality

## Notes
- Clear separation between events is crucial for user understanding
- Consider various patterns of multi-event inputs (list, paragraphs, mixed formats)
- Ensure each event has its own confidence scoring
- Provide clear visual distinction between events in the preview
- Implement smart batch detection heuristics (looking for date/time separations)
- Allow sorting/reordering of events within a batch
- This feature is valuable for processing meeting notes and agenda items
- Coordinate with Event Preview & Editing (Story 008) for consistent UI
- Consider providing templates for common batch event types (full-day agenda, conference schedule, etc.)
