# Story: Background Service Infrastructure

**Status**: To Do

---

## Related Requirement
[Novel Events Extraction](../requirements.md#2-novel-events-extraction-secondary-feature)
- "System must connect to user's Google Calendar as a background service"
- "Run on a user-configured schedule"

## Alignment with Design
[Feature: Novel Events Extraction (Background Service)](../design.md#feature-novel-events-extraction-background-service)
- "Run as a scheduled background service"
- "Execute based on user-defined schedule"

[Infrastructure Architecture](../architecture.md#infrastructure-architecture)
- "Scheduled Jobs: Background service for novel events extraction and email delivery"

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Scheduled job infrastructure that runs reliably
- [ ] Support for user-defined schedules (daily, weekdays, weekly)
- [ ] User-configurable time of day for job execution
- [ ] Proper handling of timezone differences
- [ ] Job execution tracking and logging
- [ ] Automatic recovery from failures
- [ ] Prevention of duplicate job executions
- [ ] Resource management to prevent overload
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting for job failures
- [ ] Support for manual triggering for testing
- [ ] User must sign off on functionality before story can be marked complete

## Tasks
- [ ] Research and select job scheduling framework/library
- [ ] Design job scheduling architecture
- [ ] Implement job scheduler service
- [ ] Create scheduling configuration storage
- [ ] Build job execution tracking system
- [ ] Implement timezone-aware scheduling
- [ ] Add failure recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Create locking mechanism to prevent duplicate runs
- [ ] Implement resource management constraints
- [ ] Add logging for job execution events
- [ ] Create monitoring and alerting system
- [ ] Build manual trigger endpoint for testing
- [ ] Test scheduling with various configurations
- [ ] Document background service implementation

## Notes
- This infrastructure will initially support the Novel Events Extraction feature but should be designed to support other scheduled jobs in the future
- Consider using a distributed scheduler like node-cron, agenda, or bull for reliability
- Jobs should be idempotent to prevent issues with accidental duplicate executions
- The system should handle daylight saving time transitions gracefully
- Consider implementing job queuing for better resource management
- Monitoring should track successful executions, failures, and execution time
- The architecture should support horizontal scaling if needed
- Scheduled jobs should run in a separate process to avoid impacting the main application
