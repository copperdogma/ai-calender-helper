   - Handle flexible time formats
   - Provide fallback duration for events

3. **Participant Management**:
   - Validate email addresses
   - Handle participants without emails
   - Store both names and emails
   - Support multiple participants

4. **Event Structure**:

   - Required fields validation
   - Optional fields with defaults
   - Clear separation of metadata

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Graceful fallbacks for parsing errors
   - Clear error messages

## Notable Code Snippets
1. Event Data Structure:
```python
{
    "title": str,
    "status": "confirmed",
    "busy": True,
    "participants": [{"name": str, "email": str}],
    "description": str,
    "when": {
        "object": "timespan",
        "start_time": int,

## AI Prompts Analysis

### 1. Event Details Extraction Prompt
**Purpose**: Extract structured event information from natural language description
**Usage**: Primary event parsing
**Model**: GPT-4o-mini
**Response Format**: Pydantic CalendarEvent model
```python
system_message = f"""
Extract the event details based on the following structure: title, description, when, location, and participants. 
The current date and time is {current_time}. 
Please ensure WHEN is a date or time description that can be converted into a standard date format. 
Put some details in the title. 
Missing parts fill with 'unknown'.
"""
```
**Key Features**:
- Time-aware context inclusion
- Structured output enforcement
- Fallback value handling
- Title detail requirements

### 2. Participant Extraction Prompt
**Purpose**: Parse participant information from event description
**Usage**: Extract names and emails of event participants
**Model**: GPT-4o-mini
**Response Format**: JSON object
```python
prompt = f"""
Extract the participants' names and emails from the following event description. 
Return the result as a json of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains a "name" as a key and an "email" as a value. 
If the email is not available, set the value of "email" to None.
For example:
- If the input is "Alice will attend the meeting", return {{"participants": [{{"name": "Alice", "email": null}}]}}.
- If the input is "Alice (alice@example.com) and Bob will attend the meeting", return {{"participants": [{{"name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com"}}, {{"name": "Bob", "email": null}}]}}.
"""
```
**Key Features**:
- Clear example-based instruction
- Structured JSON output
- Null handling for missing emails
- Multiple participant support

### 3. End Time Inference Prompt
**Purpose**: Determine event end time from context
**Usage**: Calculate event duration and end time
**Model**: GPT-4o-mini
**Response Format**: JSON object
```python
prompt = f"""
Extract the end time from the following event description. The current date and time is {current_time}. 
If the end time is not explicitly mentioned, try to calculate it based on the current time and the duration mentioned in the description. 
Return the result as a string in the JSON format {{"end_time": "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"}}.
If can't get the end time, return 'unknow'.
For example:
- If the input is "The current date is 2023-09-15. The meeting will start at 3 PM and end at 4 PM", return {{"end_time": "2023-09-15 16:00:00"}}.
- If the input is "The meeting will last for 2 hours", and the current time is "2023-09-15 14:00:00", return {{"end_time": "2023-09-15 16:00:00"}}.
