## Notable Code Snippets

## AI Prompts Analysis

### 1. Event Data Extraction Prompt
**Location**: `functions/util/prompts.js`
**Usage**: Called in `processEmail` function to extract event details from email content
**Complete Prompt**:
```
Task: Review the following email thread and return a event_json with the following fields:
{
summary: the title of the event
location: a location of the event if one has been given
description: a description of the event if one has been given
conference_call: true or false, if the event is a conference call or virtual
date: DD MMMM YYYY - the date of the event
start_time: HH:mm - the start time of the event in 24 hour format
end_time: HH:mm - the end time of the event in 24 hour format
attendees: a list of attendees
}

The text will start with a Date. That is the date the email was sent.
The next line is a subject, that is the subject of the email thread.
Attendees should be selected based on the contents of the text. Generally everyone in the thread should be invited, but consider the contents of the email and the subject.
If the email is transactional, such as a receipt or automatically generated, than the only attendee is the sender.
If the email is a thread,  the most recent email is most relevant, but keep other details from the thread in context.
Relative dates are fine - like "next tuesday". Determine the date of the event based off of the relative difference from the date of the email.
Set the "summary" and "description" to "Event" if there are not enough details in the text to complete either of these fields.

To create an event, at minimum, you need to determine a date. If you can't determine a date, respond with an error that no date has been provided:
{
error: "No date provided"
description: "A short outline of what was specifically missing from the email"
}

[Examples omitted for brevity - see original file for complete examples]

Respond only with JSON.
```

### 2. Timezone Detection Prompt
**Location**: `functions/util/prompts.js`
**Usage**: Called in `processEmail` function to determine event timezone
**Complete Prompt**:
```
Task: Review the following email thread and return a timezone_json with the IANA Time Zone of the event.
{
  reason: Brief reasoning of why the timezone was chosen
  timezone:  IANA Time Zone Database formatted string
}

If a timezone is not explicitly given, you can determine it based on the location (if a location is available). 
Do your best to infer a timezone from the details in the email.
If no location or timezone is available, you can leave it undefined.

[Examples omitted for brevity - see original file for complete examples]
```

### Usage Implementation
**File**: `functions/util/openai.js`
```javascript
async function processEmail(email, headers) {
  const text = `
  Date: ${headers.Date}
  Subject: ${headers.Subject}
  From: ${headers.From}
  ${email.text}`;

  const eventMessages = [
    {
      role: "system",
      content: prompts.getEventData,
    },
    {role: "user", content: text},
  ];
  const timezoneMessages = [
    {
      role: "system",
      content: prompts.getEventTimezone,
    },
    {role: "user", content: text},
  ];

  const [eventResponse, timezoneResponse] = await Promise.all([
    defaultCompletion(eventMessages),
    defaultCompletion(timezoneMessages),
  ]);

  // ... response processing ...
}
```

### Configuration
**Model**: GPT-4-1106-preview
**Default Settings**:
- Temperature: 0.1
- Max Tokens: 4096
- Response Format: JSON

### Prompt Usage Flow
1. Email Processing:
   - Email text and headers are formatted into a standard input format
   - Two parallel prompts are executed:
     - Event data extraction
     - Timezone detection
   - Results are combined into final event object

2. Response Processing:
   - JSON responses are validated
   - Undefined values are normalized
   - Timezone is added to event data
   - Results are passed to calendar creation

3. Error Handling:
   - JSON parsing errors trigger retries
   - Missing required fields return structured error responses
   - Invalid timezones fall back to calendar default

### Integration Points
1. Email Handler:
   ```javascript
   // functions/util/emailHandler.js
   const event = await processEmail(email, headers);
   ```

2. Calendar Creation:
   ```javascript
   // functions/util/calendarHelper.js
   const timeObject = generateTimeObject(event, primaryCalendar);
   ```

3. ICS Processing:
   ```javascript
   // functions/util/openai.js
   async function parseICS(ics) {
     const messages = [
       {
         role: "system",
         content: prompts.parseICS,
       },
       {role: "user", content: ics},
     ];
     return await defaultCompletion(messages);
   }
   ```
