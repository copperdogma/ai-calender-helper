# Scratchpad - Requirements Phase

**Current Phase**: MVP Requirements Gathering

**MVP Checklist**
- [x] Define core problem and purpose:
  - [x] Who are the target users? → Users who manage their schedule with Google Calendar
  - [x] What problem does this solve? → Reduces manual calendar management effort and improves event visibility
  - [x] How will users measure success? → Time saved in calendar management, accuracy of event creation
- [x] Identify MVP features:
  - [x] Core functionality defined (2 key capabilities)
  - [x] Critical constraints documented (API integration, parsing requirements)
  - [x] Minimum user journey outlined
- [x] Separate nice-to-haves from essentials
- [x] Document in `/docs/requirements.md`:
  - [x] Clear MVP definition
  - [x] Prioritized feature list
  - [x] Core flows documented
  - [x] Non-requirements section populated

**Project Type Selection**
- [ ] Determine appropriate project type:
  - [ ] Review available types in `/bootstrapping/project-types/`
  - [ ] Analyze options:
     - [ ] Programming: For software development projects
     - [ ] Research: For research-oriented projects
     - [ ] [Other types as available]
  - [ ] Provide rationale for recommendation
- [ ] Present options with clear descriptions
- [ ] If user discusses implementation details prematurely:
  - [ ] Document these in the "Non-Requirements Detail" section at the bottom of requirements.md for later
  - [ ] Guide back to project type selection first
- [ ] Get explicit confirmation of project type choice

**Ready to Build?**
- When the MVP is clearly defined and project type selected, ask:
  "I think we have enough requirements for an MVP version of the project. Would you like to start building with the [selected_project_type] project type?"
- If yes, run: `./bootstrapping/scripts/transition_to_execute.sh [project_type]`
    - Then read the new scratchpad.mdc and scratchpad.md and follow the new instructions.

**User Input**
- Project Name: AI Calendar Helper
- Core Features:
  1. Daily summary of novel upcoming Google Calendar events
  2. Natural language event creation from unstructured text
- Integration Requirements:
  - Google Calendar API integration required
  - Support for parsing unstructured text into event details

**Progress**
- [x] Define core problem and purpose:
  - [x] Who are the target users? → Users who manage their schedule with Google Calendar
  - [x] What problem does this solve? → Reduces manual calendar management effort and improves event visibility
  - [x] How will users measure success? → Time saved in calendar management, accuracy of event creation
- [x] Identify MVP features:
  - [x] Core functionality defined (2 key capabilities)
  - [x] Critical constraints documented (API integration, parsing requirements)
  - [x] Minimum user journey outlined
- [x] Separate nice-to-haves from essentials
- [x] Document in `/docs/requirements.md`:
  - [x] Clear MVP definition
  - [x] Prioritized feature list
  - [x] Core flows documented
  - [x] Non-requirements section populated

**Next Steps**
Based on the requirements gathered, this appears to be a "programming" project type as it involves:
- Software development for calendar integration
- Natural language processing
- API integration
- User interface development

Would you like to review the requirements and confirm if you're ready to proceed with the "programming" project type? Are there any additional requirements or clarifications needed before we move forward?
